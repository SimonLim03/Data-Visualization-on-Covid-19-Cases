Dataset:  Covid Cases and Deaths WorldWide | KaggleLinks to an external site.

 

## 1. Summary of dataset

- I started searching for various dataset on Kaggle, in which a diverse range of topics were available as a dataset. 
- I have chosen the dataset associated with reported Covid-19 cases and deaths by country or territory, as the dataset contains precise and massive numbers of data and hence visualisation of these variables would provide clear insights and make people easier to understand the meaningful narrative of dataset.

### The dataset contains the following variables:
- Serial number: Serial number of country
- Country: Name of the country
- Total cases: Total cases in the following country
- Total deaths: Total deaths in the following country
- Total recovered: Total recovered in the following country
- Active cases: Total active cases in the following country
- Total test: Total Covid Test in the following country
- Population: Population of the following country

## 2. Rationale of Visualisation Tool â€“ Python Packages
- Python is one of the most common and advanced programming languages, which can be potentially and variously used to visualise and obtain insights in the process of data analysis.
- I have chosen python visualisation packages as my fist visualisation tool, as they enable to create a variety of plots, bars and charts, presented in the most simple and effective ways. 
- Additionally, python packages enabled to easily manipulate labels, colours and designs of the graphs and visualise data in various formats. Lastly, preparation and cleaning of data phases can be easily done with python packages as well, and hence smoothly connecting to data visualisation of dataset.

## 3. Data Processing and Cleaning
### Data Loading

- The process of data import and loading data was very simple and straightforward using python package, Pandas. This package also further enables to provide the summary and description of dataset, which helps to visualise massive numbers of data more effectively and precisely.

### Data Cleaning

- The missing values in each column enabled me to check missing values in each column. In addition, I was also able to test if those missing values are caused from manual errors or zero values.

- I used python packages, such as Matplotlib.pyplot and plotly.express for visualization. Those packages enabled me to visualize data using bars and scatter plots in various formats and designs and hence making it much easier to understand the whole narrative of dataset.
- Accordingly, USA had the most deaths affected by COVID-19, while Japan has the highest recovery rate per case.
- Lastly, there is a positive correlation between population and total deaths.
